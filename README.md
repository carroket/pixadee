# Pixadee

**Yet Another JavaScript Drawing Library**

## Overview

This is my JavaScript drawing library. There are many like it (more or less), but this one is mine. Well, it will be when I get around to putting some of my commonly useful drawing code here. Specifically, I intend to start with functionality to enable easy drawing of shapes such as stars and arcs.

In the meantime, you may wish to see my [Circle, Arc, and Ring Experiments](http://jsfiddle.net/briansexton/W49p2/) on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/briansexton/W49p2/).

## Why "Pixadee"?

I had to call the library something and my main goal for it, at least initially, has been to enable easy drawing of complex and mathematically challenging shapes, so I initially referred to it as "Shapely". That name was simple and descriptive, but not sufficiently distinct from the names of other projects, so I wanted to come up with something else. "Pixadee" seems both more distinctive and more fun and I was already planning to use it for a related project years ago, so there it is!

Pixel + Chickadee = Pixadee
