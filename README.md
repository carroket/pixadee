# Shapely

**Yet Another JavaScript Drawing Library**

## Overview

This is my JavaScript drawing library. There are many like it (more or less), but this one is mine. Well, it will be when I get around to putting some of my commonly useful drawing code here. Specifically, I intend to start with functionality to enable easy drawing of shapes such as stars and arcs.

In the meantime, you may wish to see my [Circle, Arc, and Ring Experiments](http://jsfiddle.net/briansexton/W49p2/) on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/briansexton/W49p2/).

## Why "Shapely"?

I had to call the library something and my main goal for it, at least initially, is to enable easy drawing of complex and mathematically challenging shapes. I may change the name later.

## Who is making this?

Shapely is being made by [Brian Sexton](http://briansexton.com/) of [Carroket, Inc.](http://carroket.com/)
